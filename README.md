# Bearded Tinker — Video Assets

This repository contains code, YAML snippets and supporting files referenced in my YouTube videos (mostly Home Assistant, but also maker / hardware projects).

## Where to start
Browse the repository root.

Each video has its own folder (e.g. `smoke-detected-whole-house-alert-sensereo-ms1/`) with:
- a short README (what it does + prerequisites)
- YAML/code used in the video
- optional diagrams, screenshots, or links

## ⚠️ Notes

- Safety-related automations are an **extra layer** — always rely on certified hardware and follow local regulations.
