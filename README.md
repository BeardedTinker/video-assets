# Bearded Tinker — Video Assets

This repository grows with the channel.  
Every folder contains real-world Home Assistant logic — tested, deployed, and running in production.

You’ll find structured Home Assistant YAML examples, automation logic, helper configurations, and supporting files referenced in my YouTube videos (mostly Home Assistant, but also maker / hardware projects).

## Where to start
Browse the repository root.

Each video has its own folder (e.g. `smoke-detected-whole-house-alert-sensereo-ms1/`) with:
- a short README (what it does + prerequisites)
- YAML/code used in the video
- optional diagrams, screenshots, or links

All examples are designed for practical, real-world setups — not lab demos.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Safety-related automations are an **extra layer** — always rely on certified hardware and follow local regulations.
