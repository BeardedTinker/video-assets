# Bearded Tinker — Video Assets

This repository contains code, YAML snippets and supporting files referenced in my YouTube videos (mostly Home Assistant).

## Where to start
Browse the repository root.

Each video has its own folder (e.g. `smoke-detected-whole-house-alert-sensereo-ms1/`) with:
- a short README (what it does + prerequisites)
- YAML/code used in the video
- optional diagrams/links/files

## Videos
- [Smoke Detected → Whole House Alert (Sensereo MS1)](./smoke-detected-whole-house-alert-sensereo-ms1/)

## ⚠️ Notes
- Secrets/tokens are removed and replaced with placeholders.
- Entity IDs and device names may need to be adapted to your setup.
- Safety automations are an **extra layer** — use certified devices and follow local regulations.
