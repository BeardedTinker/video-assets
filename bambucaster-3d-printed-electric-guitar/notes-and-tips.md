# Notes & Tips (Real-World Build)

## 🧠 The “easy mode” part
The biggest surprise: printing the parts was the easy part.
The Bambu Lab P2S made this project feel simple and repeatable — especially compared to my Voron builds.

## 🧩 Why 2x AMS matters
Having 2x AMS makes multi-material printing way more practical:
- clean swaps
- faster workflow
- fewer “I’ll do it later” moments

## 🧱 Materials I tested
- PLA Basic: reliable, clean, easy
- PLA-CF: stiff, strong, and looks premium
- Wood PLA: looks amazing on the guitar body parts
- (Bonus: I also tested TPU for AMS in other projects)

## ✨ Plates that gave the best “wow”
The hologram plate is pure content fuel.
Even simple parts look expensive.

## ⚠️ The real build challenges
Printing is one thing.
Assembly is where you’ll spend time:
- alignment
- tightening
- shielding (copper tape)
- threaded inserts
- getting everything to feel “real instrument” solid

## 🎸 And yes… it plays
I’m not a guitarist.
I know about two notes.
But it plays — and that’s the whole point of this project.

## 🔥 Final thought
If you want a project that looks impossible but is actually doable:
this is one of the best “3D printing flex” builds you can do.
